#Air Quality Prediction USing AI 



CONCLUSION:



We performed a series of analyses, and came to some rather interesting conclusions. Our methodology included collecting the Air Quality Index (AQI) data in four areas in Delhi in 2016 as well as 2015 and drawing spatial as well as temporal comparisons to give a clear picture of what was happening. We also collected data from 2014 but it was sparse, and yet it supported our findings definitively, if not conclusively. One of the most relevant is the fact that this year was truly anomalous, if only firecrackers are considered major pollutants during and after 30th October. Comparing the AQI this year to that observed in 2015, it was obvious that firecrackers could not have caused the shocking level of pollution seen this year.
